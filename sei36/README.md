### Homework Repository

1. Repository Setup;
2. Do Your Homework;
3. Submit Your Homework.

### Repository Setup

You only need to do this once, not every time you're submitting homework!

- **Fork this repository**
  - _'Forking' creates a personal, 'forked' copy of this repository on your Github account._
  - Hit the **Fork** button in the top right-hand corner of this page.
- **Clone your forked repository to your computer**
  - _'Cloning' takes your 'forked' repository on GitHub and creates a local copy - or 'clone' - on your computer._
  - Make sure you're browser is open to **your** forked version of this repository on Github (eg [http://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/sei36](http://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/sei36)).
  - Hit the **Clone or Download** button in the top right-hand corner of the page and copy the URL to your clipboard.
  - Open your computer's terminal to the directory in which you intend to store your homework.
  - `git clone url_of_your_fork_on_github` (where `url_of_your_fork_on_github` is the URL you copied after hitting 'Clone or Download', above).
- **Add an upstream remote repository**
  - _Adding an upstream repository links the local repository on your computer to the original repository on Github (i.e. mine, the one from which you created the fork)_
  - `cd sei34-homework`
  - `git remote add upstream sldkfj`
  - `git pull upstream master`

### Do your Homework

You should put each night's homework in a new folder within the appropriate directory of your homework repo. So, for day two, where you have two tasks ("Calculator" and "Strings"), you might do something like this:

1. Open Terminal/iTerm2;
2. Go to your local homework repo (eg, `cd ~/sei/homework`);
3. From here, go to the folder matching your name within that repo, and the appropriate week (eg, `taylor_swift/week_01`);
4. Create new folders for each of the day's homework tasks: (eg `mkdir calculator` and `mkdir strings`);
5. Create the files necessary to complete the homework in their respective directories;
6. Get to it!

### Submit Your Homework

You need to do this every time you're submitting homework.

- **Commit your work to your local repository progressively**
  - Make sure you are the correct folder containing the homework you want to submit.
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE"`(where `YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE` is your description of the work you are committing)
- **Push your changes to your forked repository**
  - `git pull upstream master` - merge changes that have been made to this repository into your own local repository.
  - `git push origin master`
- **Once you're finished, submit a pull request for me to accept your homework**
  - Navigate to your forked version of this repository on Github (eg [https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME_HERE}/sei36](https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME_HERE}/sei36)).
  - Hit the **Pull request** button.
  - Make sure the destination for the pull request is set to my repository, not your own or anyone else's.
  * **IMPORTANT:** In the pull request comment, tell me the following:
    1. How difficult did you find this (out of 10)? 0 being no problems at all, 10 being impossible;
    2. Was there anything that you struggled with?;
    3. Is there anything that you'd like some further information on?;
    4. Roughly how long did it take?

**If you don't mention anything in the Pull Request comments, we will assume you had no problems at all with it, and you will receive no feedback about your homework.**

If you want to follow up on any issues you had with the homework, the ideal time for that will be during the more unstructured lab time after lunch - come and see Joel or myself then and we can go over any outstanding questions.

**Note:** if I haven't yet merged your Pull Request into my master homework repo before it's time to submit the next day's homework, you won't be able to create a new Pull Request. That's okay - for the new homework just add a new comment to the open (existing) Pull Request, featuring the same four points given above to describe your response to it.
